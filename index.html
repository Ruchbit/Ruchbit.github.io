			<p>Romania has very few animal welfare laws. The stray dog problem is beyond crisis point, and the public shelters are full. The shelters in Romania are not like those in the UK.  They are filthy and riddled with disease, the dog’s don’t receive enough food, puppies, old dogs and young adult dogs are all kennelled together.</p>
